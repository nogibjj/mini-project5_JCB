# IDS 706 Mini-Project 5

## Python Scripting, SQL, and Fostering Unified Commitment

Building on what I've been working on in the past mini-projects as well as the Individual Project, I've added a main.py script that allows you to interact with a sqlite3 database.

Current functionality allows one to:
- Create new Open, High, Low, Close tables
- Insert new or add to existing OHLC tables in the database
- Query the existing database to return a polars dataframe
- Query the database and plot a currency's returns
